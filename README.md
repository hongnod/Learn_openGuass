# Install openGauss_2.0.0 Simplified on Debian 10



OpenGauss community released openGauss 2.0 recently, with this release, they provide a simplified package with official supporting Centos and OpenEuler. I trid the OpenEuler version on Debian 10 with succes, the step is:
```
1 Download openguass and unzip to des folder;
2 Setting enviroment: add $GAUSSHOME, append $GAUSSHOE/bin to $PATH, and $GAUSSHOE/lib to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
3 run gs_initdb to test which libs are lack, install them;
4 run gs_initdb to init the database;
5 run gs_ctl to start the database;
6 run gsql to create and grant a login user (initail user is not allowed to login)
7 test connecton and more setting such as remote accessing. more
```
process noted as:
```
user@debian:~$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/opt/opengauss/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
user@debian:~$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The program "gaussdb" is needed by gs_initdb but was not found in the
same directory as "/opt/opengauss/bin/gs_initdb".

The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "user".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.UTF-8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run gs_initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server of single node using:

    gaussdb -D /opt/opengauss/data/gsdb --single_node
or
    gs_ctl start -D /opt/opengauss/data/gsdb -Z single_node -l logfile

Due to different auth method, postgresql client can not connect og. there is an option(from: https://github.com/ljlilzu/ljlilzu.github.io/tree/master/course):
```
1 Download libpq-og.dll from this repo;
2 Download HeidiSQL;
3 Put libpq-og.dll into HeidiSQL home folder;
4 Start HeidiSQL configuration with libpq-og.dll
5 enjoy
```
